"""
In this practical task, you are going to write unit tests for one of your
previous practical tasks. Here is an example using the OOP Classes task.

If you would like to run all tests, you can use the following command in your terminal:
    python -m unittest discover -s tests

Alternatively, you can run a specific test file with a command similar to this:
    python -m unittest tests/test_email.py
