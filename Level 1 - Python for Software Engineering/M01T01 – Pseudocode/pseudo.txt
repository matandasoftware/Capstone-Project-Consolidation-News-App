1.An algorithm that asks a user to enter a positive number repeatedly until 
the user enters a zero value, then determines and outputs the largest of 
the numbers that were entered.

get a positive number entry
repeat to get a positive number entry  
if a zero is entered
print the largest positive number enty 

2.An algorithm that requests a user to input their name and then stores 
their name in a variable called first_name. Subsequently, the algorithm 
should print out first_name along with the phrase “Hello, World”. 

request user input`s name and store it as first_name
print the stored first_name along with phrase "Hello, World"

3.An algorithm that reads an arbitrary number of integers and then returns 
their arithmetic average. 

(i)create variables of sum and count that both start from 0
the sum variable will consist of the sum of all the itigers
the count variable will consist of all the number of all the intigers
(ii)read every intiger and add it to every other itiger to get the sum variable
(iii)count every intiger to get the count variable
Repeat (ii) and (iii) until there are no more integers to read.
Calculate the arithmetic average by dividing the sum variable by the count variable.
print the arithmetic average

4.An algorithm that reads a grocery list and prints out the products (in 
alphabetical order) that are still left to buy. 

Read the grocery list and store it in a list 
Sort the list in alphabetical order
Create an empty list to store the products that are still left to buy
pick a product to buy from the alphabetically sorted list
For each product, ask the user to enter/mark whether it has been bought or not
If the product has not been bought, add it to the list of products that are still left to buy
After purchasing some of the alphabetically sorted, print out the list of products that are still left to buy(not entered/marked as bought)

5.An algorithm for the flowchart on the following page: 

An algorithm that has two variable X and Y, uses their inputs to get S which is the addition of the two variable, A which is the mean of the two variables and P which is the product of the two variables.
