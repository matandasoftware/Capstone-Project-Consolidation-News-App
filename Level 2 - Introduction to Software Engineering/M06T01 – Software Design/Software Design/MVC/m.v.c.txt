Models:
- Represent domain data (Task objects).
- Validate business rules (e.g., required title).
- Provide serialization (to/from dict) for persistence.
- Expose methods to query and manipulate tasks (TaskManager).

Views:
- Present data to the user (CLI, web page, or GUI).
- Render lists, single task details, forms for create/update.
- Handle basic input validation and formatting.

Controllers:
- Coordinate user actions and model updates.
- Translate view input into model operations (create/read/update/delete).
- Handle error cases and select the appropriate view response.
- Orchestrate persistence via FileStorage.

Storage (FileStorage component):
- Abstract file I/O and data persistence (save/load JSON or CSV).
- Encapsulate path management and atomic writes.
- Return deserialized Task objects to the TaskManager.

Testing & Extensibility notes:
- Keep models free of view logic to allow multiple UI implementations.
- Controllers should be thin and delegate business logic to models.
- FileStorage can be swapped for a database-backed implementation with minimal controller changes.
