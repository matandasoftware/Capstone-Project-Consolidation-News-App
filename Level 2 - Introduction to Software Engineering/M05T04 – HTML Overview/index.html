    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
    
    <h2>Building Houses Out of Sand After the Rain</h2>

    <p>After every rainfall, I would rush outside to find the <strong>perfect patches of wet sand</strong> to build elaborate houses. The damp sand held together so well, allowing me to create walls, rooms, and even little gardens.</p>
    <p>I remember one time building an <em>entire village</em> with my friends after a big storm. We spent hours constructing roads between the houses and decorating them with leaves and small stones.</p>
    
    <h2>Making and Flying Kites During August</h2>

    <p>August was always <strong>special to me</strong> because it was my birthday season – I was born on <em>August 27th</em>. This was the perfect time to make and fly kites with the warm summer winds.</p>
    <p>I loved designing my own kites with colorful paper and sticks, then watching them <strong>soar high in the sky</strong>. Flying kites during my birthday month made every August feel magical and full of freedom.</p>
    
    <h1>Toys</h1>
    
    <h2>Anime Character Toy</h2>
    <img src="anime character.webp" alt="Anime action figure toy" width="400">
    <p>I had an <strong>anime character toy with batteries</strong> that made a certain sound and slight movements when I pressed a button on its back. I loved playing with it and pressing that button over and over just to hear the sounds.</p>
    <p>Of course, my <em>curiosity got the better of me</em>, and I eventually opened it up to see how it functioned inside. Like all my childhood toys, I was always curious about how they came to function the way they did, but in the end, this made them not work the way they used to.</p>
    
    <h2>Remote Controlled Car</h2>

    <p>My remote controlled car was <strong>one of my favorite toys</strong> to play with, especially racing it around the house and making it do sharp turns. The thrill of controlling it from a distance was incredibly exciting.</p>
    <p>Eventually, I couldn't resist taking it apart to see <em>how the mechanics worked</em> – the motors, the wires, and how the remote communicated with the car. Unfortunately, like with all my other toys, my curiosity meant that it never quite worked the same way again after I reassembled it.</p>
