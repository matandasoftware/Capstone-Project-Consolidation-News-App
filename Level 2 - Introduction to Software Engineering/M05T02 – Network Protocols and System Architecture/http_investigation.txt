testing (tested on Tue, 16 Dec 2025). Multiple attempts to connect to all 
endpoints (/get, /post, /status/404, /status/403) resulted in 503 errors from 
the load balancer (Server: awselb/2.0).

Alternative service httpbingo.org was used instead, which provides identical 
functionality to httpbin.org. Both services:

- Are HTTP request/response testing services
- Have the same endpoints and API
- Return the same JSON response format
- Reflect back request details for debugging

All commands below use httpbingo.org as httpbin.org was completely unavailable.

1. BASIC REQUEST ANALYSIS (GET METHOD)

EXECUTED COMMANDS:

for curl:

ORIGINAL TASK COMMANDS (httpbin.org was down with 503 errors):
curl -v https://httpbin.org/get

for PowerShell

Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://httpbin.org/get -Verbose

THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS RUN (using working alternative):

CURL:

Connection Workflow (CURL -v shows more detail):

1. DNS RESOLUTION: Host httpbingo.org:443 resolved to IPv4 66.241.125.232
2. TCP CONNECTION: Trying 66.241.125.232:443 from local IP 192.168.8.4 port 65086
3. TLS HANDSHAKE: schannel negotiates SSL/TLS connection, ALPN selects HTTP/1.1
4. CONNECTION ESTABLISHED: Secured connection to httpbingo.org established
5. CLIENT SENDS REQUEST: GET /get HTTP/1.1 with headers (Host, User-Agent, Accept)
6. REQUEST SENT: "Request completely sent off" (0-byte payload for GET)
7. TLS RENEGOTIATION: Server requests SSL/TLS renegotiation (security)
8. SERVER RESPONSE: HTTP/1.1 200 OK with response headers
9. BODY TRANSMISSION: Server sends 565-byte JSON body with request details
10. CONNECTION KEPT ALIVE: "Connection #0 to host httpbingo.org:443 left intact"

.

2. METHOD INTERACTION (POST for curl vs GET for powershell)

EXECUTED COMMANDS:

for curl

ORIGINAL TASK COMMANDS (httpbin.org was down with 503 errors):

curl -X POST https://httpbin.org/post \
       -d "key=value"\
	   -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
	   
for PowerShell 
	   
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://httpbin.org/post" `
 -Method Post `
 -ContentType "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" `
 -Body "key=value"

ACTUAL COMMANDS RUN (using working alternative):

CURL:
curl -X POST https://httpbingo.org/post -d "key=value" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded"

POWERSHELL:
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://httpbingo.org/post" `
  -Method Post `
  -ContentType "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" `
  -Body "key=value" `
  -Verbose

How POST Differs from GET:

1. PAYLOAD: POST sends 9-byte payload ("key=value"), GET sends 0-byte payload
2. HEADERS: POST includes additional headers:
   - Content-Length: 9
   - Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
3. PURPOSE: GET retrieves data, POST submits data to the server
4. DATA LOCATION: GET data in URL, POST data in request body

Purpose of the Payload (key=value):

- Represents form data being submitted to the server
- Content-Type "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" tells server how to parse it
- Format: key=value pairs separated by & (if multiple)
- This is how HTML forms typically submit data to web servers

How the Payload is Transmitted:

- Sent in the HTTP request BODY (not in the URL)
- Content-Length header tells server exactly how many bytes to expect (9 bytes)
- Transmitted after all headers are sent
- More secure than GET (data not visible in URL/logs)

Server Response Body (IDENTICAL for both CURL and POWERSHELL):

The server reflects the data back showing:

- "method": "POST"
- "data": "key=value" - Raw body content as received
- "form": { "key": ["value"] } - Parsed form data
- "json": null - Not JSON format, so null
- "files": {} - No files uploaded
- Status Code: 200 OK - Data successfully received

3. STATUS CODE EXPLORATION

EXECUTED COMMANDS:

for curl:

ORIGINAL TASK COMMANDS (httpbin.org was down with 503 errors):

curl -I https://httpbin.org/status/404
curl -I https://httpbin.org/status/403

for PowerShell

Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://httpbin.org/status/404 -Method Head
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://httpbin.org/status/403 -Method Head

ACTUAL COMMANDS RUN (using working alternative):

for curl

CURL (404 Not Found):
curl -I https://httpbingo.org/status/404

CURL (403 Forbidden):
curl -I https://httpbingo.org/status/403

for PowerShell

POWERSHELL (404 Not Found):
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://httpbingo.org/status/404 -Method Head -Verbose

POWERSHELL (403 Forbidden):
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://httpbingo.org/status/403 -Method Head -Verbose

note on status codes and their meanings:

404 NOT FOUND:
--------------
Status Code: 404
Meaning: The requested resource does not exist on the server

Why might this occur?

- URL typo or incorrect path
- Resource was deleted or moved
- Incorrect routing/endpoint configuration
- Page or file never existed at that location

Headers Received (CURL):

HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
- access-control-allow-credentials: true
- access-control-allow-origin: *
- content-type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
- date: Tue, 16 Dec 2025 02:57:30 GMT
- server: Fly/c51817cfd (2025-12-11)
- via: 1.1 fly.io, 1.1 fly.io
- fly-request-id: 01KCJHETBMYFGD5X1CST5HNDV0-jnb

Headers Received (POWERSHELL):

- Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
- Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
- Date: Tue, 16 Dec 2025
- Server: Fly
- Via: 1.1 fly.io
- fly-request-id: (request identifier)

403 FORBIDDEN:

Status Code: 403
Meaning: Server understood the request but refuses to authorize it

What does this tell you about access restrictions?

- The resource EXISTS but you don't have permission to access it
- Server recognized you but denied access (authentication ≠ authorization)
- Could be due to:
  * Insufficient user privileges
  * IP address blocking
  * Geographic restrictions
  * Rate limiting
  * Resource requires specific credentials/API keys

Headers Received (CURL):

HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden

How Errors are Communicated:

1. PRIMARY: Status code (404, 403) in the HTTP response line
2. HEADERS: Standard response headers still included (Date, Server, CORS, Content-Type)
3. METHOD: HEAD method (-I in curl, -Method Head in PowerShell) returns only headers, no body
4. VERBOSE OUTPUT: PowerShell shows "Requested HTTP/1.1 HEAD with 0-byte payload"

KEY TAKEAWAYS ABOUT HTTP

1. REQUEST/RESPONSE WORKFLOW:

   - Client sends request (method, headers, optional body)
   - Server processes and sends response (status code, headers, body)
   - All communication follows HTTP protocol structure
   - curl -v shows detailed TCP/TLS handshake and connection establishment
   - PowerShell -Verbose shows simplified request/response flow

2. METHODS HAVE DIFFERENT PURPOSES:

   - GET: Retrieve data (no body, idempotent, cacheable)
   - POST: Submit data (has body, non-idempotent, not cached by default)
   - HEAD: Get headers only (efficient status checking, curl uses -I flag)

3. HEADERS PROVIDE METADATA:

   - Request headers: What client sends (User-Agent, Accept-Encoding, Content-Type)
   - Response headers: What server sends (Date, Server, Content-Type, CORS)
   - Content-Type and Content-Length are critical for body transmission
   - Different tools send different User-Agent headers (curl/8.16.0 vs PowerShell/7.5.4)

4. STATUS CODES COMMUNICATE OUTCOMES:

   - 2xx: Success (200 OK)
   - 4xx: Client errors (404 Not Found, 403 Forbidden)
   - 5xx: Server errors (503 Service Unavailable)
   - Status code alone tells you if request succeeded
   - Both curl and PowerShell handle status codes identically

5. DATA TRANSMISSION:

   - GET: Data in URL query parameters (visible, limited size)
   - POST: Data in request body (more secure, larger size)
   - Form-encoded data uses Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
   - Both tools transmit POST data identically (Content-Length: 9 for "key=value")

6. SECURITY & ACCESS CONTROL:

   - 403 indicates authorization issue (exists but denied)
   - 404 indicates resource doesn't exist
   - HTTPS encrypts transmission (port 443)
   - CORS headers control cross-origin access
   - TLS/SSL handshake visible in curl -v output

7. EFFICIENCY:

   - HEAD method retrieves only headers (no body)
   - Transfer-Encoding: chunked allows streaming (PowerShell)
   - Content-Length provides exact size (curl)
   - Accept-Encoding enables compression (gzip, deflate, br)

8. CURL vs POWERSHELL COMPARISON:

   - FUNCTIONALITY: Both produce identical HTTP requests and responses
   - VERBOSITY: curl -v shows more network details (DNS, TCP, TLS)
   - SYNTAX: curl has simpler syntax (-X, -d, -I flags)
   - OUTPUT: PowerShell provides structured objects, curl shows raw text
   - USER-AGENT: Different default User-Agent strings identify the tool used
   - HEADERS: curl shows lowercase headers, PowerShell uses Title-Case
